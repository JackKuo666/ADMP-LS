Here, we developed a new algorithm for determining HLA alleles using next-generation sequencing (NGS) results. The method consists of constructing an extensive dictionary of HLA alleles, precise mapping of the NGS reads, and calculating a score based on weighted read counts to select the most suitable pair of alleles. The developed algorithm compares the score of all allele pairs, taking into account variation not only in the domain for antigen presentation (G-DOMAIN), but also outside this domain. Using this method, HLA alleles could be determined with 6-digit precision. We showed that our method was more accurate than other NGS-based methods and revealed limitations of the conventional HLA typing technologies. Furthermore, we determined the complete genomic sequence of an HLA-A-like-pseudogene when we assembled NGS reads that had caused arguable typing, and found its identity with HLA-Y*02:01.

We present a single base-resolution sequencing methodology that sequences complete genetics and the two most common cytosine modifications in a single workflow. DNA is copied and bases are enzymatically converted. Coupled decoding of bases across the original and copy strand provides a phased digital readout. Methods are demonstrated on human genomic DNA and cell-free DNA from a blood sample of a patient with cancer.

The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.\", \"author\": \"J C Venter, M D Adams, E W Myers, P W Li, R J Mural, G G Sutton, H O Smith, M Yandell, C A Evans, R A Holt, J D Gocayne, P Amanatides, R M Ballew, D H Huson, J R Wortman, Q Zhang, C D Kodira, X H Zheng, L Chen, M Skupski, G Subramanian, P D Thomas, J Zhang, G L Gabor Miklos, C Nelson, S Broder, A G Clark, J Nadeau, V A McKusick, N Zinder, A J Levine, R J Roberts, M Simon, C Slayman, M Hunkapiller, R Bolanos, A Delcher, I Dew, D Fasulo, M Flanigan, L Florea, A Halpern, S Hannenhalli, S Kravitz, S Levy, C Mobarry, K Reinert, K Remington, J Abu-Threideh, E Beasley, K Biddick, V Bonazzi, R Brandon, M Cargill, I Chandramouliswaran, R Charlab, K Chaturvedi, Z Deng, V Di Francesco, P Dunn, K Eilbeck, C Evangelista, A E Gabrielian, W Gan, W Ge, F Gong, Z Gu, P Guan, T J Heiman, M E Higgins, R R Ji, Z Ke, K A Ketchum, Z Lai, Y Lei, Z Li, J Li, Y Liang, X Lin, F Lu, G V Merkulov, N Milshina, H M Moore, A K Naik, V A Narayan, B Neelam, D Nusskern, D B Rusch, S Salzberg, W Shao, B Shue, J Sun, Z Wang, A Wang, X Wang, J Wang, M Wei, R Wides, C Xiao, C Yan, A Yao, J Ye, M Zhan, W Zhang, H Zhang, Q Zhao, L Zheng, F Zhong, W Zhong, S Zhu, S Zhao, D Gilbert, S Baumhueter, G Spier, C Carter, A Cravchik, T Woodage, F Ali, H An, A Awe, D Baldwin, H Baden, M Barnstead, I Barrow, K Beeson, D Busam, A Carver, A Center, M L Cheng, L Curry, S Danaher, L Davenport, R Desilets, S Dietz, K Dodson, L Doup, S Ferriera, N Garg, A Gluecksmann, B Hart, J Haynes, C Haynes, C Heiner, S Hladun, D Hostin, J Houck, T Howland, C Ibegwam, J Johnson, F Kalush, L Kline, S Koduru, A Love, F Mann, D May, S McCawley, T McIntosh, I McMullen, M Moy, L Moy, B Murphy, K Nelson, C Pfannkoch, E Pratts, V Puri, H Qureshi, M Reardon, R Rodriguez, Y H Rogers, D Romblad, B Ruhfel, R Scott, C Sitter, M Smallwood, E Stewart, R Strong, E Suh, R Thomas, N N Tint, S Tse, C Vech, G Wang, J Wetter, S Williams, M Williams, S Windsor, E Winn-Deen, K Wolfe, J Zaveri, K Zaveri, J F Abril, R Guig\\u00f3, M J Campbell, K V Sjolander, B Karlak, A Kejariwal, H Mi, B Lazareva, T Hatton, A Narechania, K Diemer, A Muruganujan, N Guo, S Sato, V Bafna, S Istrail, R Lippert, R Schwartz, B Walenz, S Yooseph, D Allen, A Basu, J Baxendale, L Blick, M Caminha, J Carnes-Stine, P Caulk, Y H Chiang, M Coyne, C Dahlke, A Deslattes Mays, M Dombroski, M Donnelly, D Ely, S Esparham, C Fosler, H Gire, S Glanowski, K Glasser, A Glodek, M Gorokhov, K Graham, B Gropman, M Harris, J Heil, S Henderson, J Hoover, D Jennings, C Jordan, J Jordan, J Kasha, L Kagan, C Kraft, A Levitsky, M Lewis, X Liu, J Lopez, D Ma, W Majoros, J McDaniel, S Murphy, M Newman, T Nguyen, N Nguyen, M Nodell, S Pan, J Peck, M Peterson, W Rowe, R Sanders, J Scott, M Simpson, T Smith, A Sprague, T Stockwell, R Turner, E Venter, M Wang, M Wen, D Wu, M Wu, A Xia, A Zandieh, X Zhu\", \"JournalInfo\": \"Science (New York, N.Y.).2001.doi:10.1126/science.1058040\", \"PMID\": \"11181995\"}, {\"docId\": \"355567327917510664\", \"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35444284\", \"title\": \"Somatic genomic changes in single Alzheimer's disease neurons.\", \"description\": \"Dementia in Alzheimer's disease progresses alongside neurodegeneration\", \"author\": \"Michael B Miller, August Yue Huang, Junho Kim, Zinan Zhou, Samantha L Kirkham, Eduardo A Maury, Jennifer S Ziegenfuss, Hannah C Reed, Jennifer E Neil, Lariza Rento, Steven C Ryu, Chanthia C Ma, Lovelace J Luquette, Heather M Ames, Derek H Oakley, Matthew P Frosch, Bradley T Hyman, Michael A Lodato, Eunjung Alice Lee, Christopher A Walsh\", \"JournalInfo\": \"Nature.2022.doi:10.1038/s41586-022-04640-1\", \"PMID\": \"35444284\"}, {\"docId\": \"355567327917510665\", \"url\": \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19997069\", \"title\": \"Sequencing technologies - the next generation.\", \"description\": \"Demand has never been greater for revolutionary technologies that deliver fast, inexpensive and accurate genome information.

The sugar-phosphate backbones form the \"side rails,\" while base pairs form the \"rungs\" ([11](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/dna/ \"What is DNA?: MedlinePlus Genetics\"))([15](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Genetics/Genetics_Agriculture_and_Biotechnology_(Suza_and_Lee)/01%3A_Chapters/1.02%3A_DNA-_The_Genetic_Material \"1.2: DNA- The Genetic Material - Biology LibreTexts\")).  \n- The sequence of bases (e.g., ATGCC) encodes genetic instructions, similar to letters forming words ([11](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/dna/ \"What is DNA?: MedlinePlus Genetics\"))([14](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genetic-Code \"Genetic Code - National Human Genome Research Institute\")).\n\n### 📦 4. **Cellular Location and Packaging**  \n- In eukaryotic cells, DNA resides primarily in the **nucleus** (nuclear DNA), with a small amount in **mitochondria** (mtDNA) ([11](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/dna/ \"What is DNA?: MedlinePlus Genetics\")).  \n- To fit inside the nucleus, DNA is packaged into **chromosomes** via histone proteins, forming condensed structures called **chromatin** ([15](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Genetics/Genetics_Agriculture_and_Biotechnology_(Suza_and_Lee)/01%3A_Chapters/1.02%3A_DNA-_The_Genetic_Material \"1.2: DNA- The Genetic Material - Biology LibreTexts\")).\n\n### ♻️ 5. **Replication**  \nDNA can self-replicate during cell division. Each strand serves as a template for synthesizing a complementary strand, ensuring accurate transmission of genetic information to daughter cells ([11](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/dna/ \"What is DNA?: MedlinePlus Genetics\"))([15](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Genetics/Genetics_Agriculture_and_Biotechnology_(Suza_and_Lee)/01%3A_Chapters/1.02%3A_DNA-_The_Genetic_Material \"1.2: DNA- The Genetic Material - Biology LibreTexts\")).\n\n### 💎 Key Citation  \nThese points synthesize information from documents describing DNA's biological role, chemical structure, and genetic significance ([11](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/basics/dna/ \"What is DNA?: MedlinePlus Genetics\"))([14](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genetic-Code \"Genetic Code - National Human Genome Research Institute\"))([15](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Genetics/Genetics_Agriculture_and_Biotechnology_(Suza_and_Lee)/01%3A_Chapters/1.02%3A_DNA-_The_Genetic_Material \"1.2: DNA- The Genetic Material - Biology LibreTexts\")).\n\n### 📖 References (15 citations)\n\n[1] Chandra Shekhar Pareek, Rafal Smoczynski, Andrzej Tretyn.
